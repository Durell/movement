Jean Jacques Rousseau:<br>
The Social Contract, 1763          </span>
          <hr>
<p> <span class="H_body_text"><i>Jean-Jacques Rousseau stresses, like John Lockem the idea of
  a social contract as the basis of society. Locke's version emphasised
  a contact between the governors and the governed: Rousseau's was
  in a way much more profound - the social contract was between
  all members of society, and essentially replaced "natural"
  rights as the basis for human claims.</i></span><i><br>
</i> </p>
<p class="H_Subitle"> <b>Origin and Terms of the Social Contract<br>
</b> </p>
<p> <span class="H_body_text">Man was born free, but everywhere he is in chains. This man believes
  that he is the master of others, and still he is more of a slave
  than they are. How did that transformation take place? I don't
  know. How may the restraints on man become legitimate? I do believe
  I can answer that question....<br>
</span></p>
<p class="H_body_text"> At a point in the state of nature when the obstacles to human
  preservation have become greater than each individual with his
  own strength can cope with . . ., an adequate combination of forces
  must be the result of men coming together. Still, each man's power
  and freedom are his main means of selfÂ­preservation. How
  is he to put them under the control of others without damaging
  himself . . . ?<br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> This question might be rephrased: "How is a method of associating
  to be found which will defend and protect-using the power of all-the
  person and property of each member and still enable each member
  of the group to obey only himself and to remain as free as before?"
  This is the fundamental problem; the social contract offers a
  solution to it.<br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> The very scope of the action dictates the terms of this contract
  and renders the least modification of them inadmissible, something
  making them null and void. Thus, although perhaps they have never
  been stated in so man) words, they are the same everywhere and
  tacitly conceded and recognized everywhere. And so it follows
  that each individual immediately recovers hi primitive rights
  and natural liberties whenever any violation of the social contract
  occurs and thereby loses the contractual freedom for which he
  renounced them.<br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> The social contract's terms, when they are well understood, can
  be reduced to a single stipulation: the individual member alienates
  himself totally to the whole community together with all his rights.
  This is first because conditions will be the same for everyone
  when each individual gives himself totally, and secondly, because
  no one will be tempted to make that condition of shared equality
  worse for other men....<br>
</p>
<p><span class="H_body_text"> Once this multitude is united this way into a body, an offense
  against one of its members is an offense against the body politic.
  It would be even less possible to injure the body without its
  members feeling it. Duty and interest thus equally require the
  two contracting parties to aid each other mutually. The individual
  people should be motivated from their double roles as individuals
  and members of the body, to combine all the advantages which mutual
  aid offers them....</span><br>
</p>
<p class="H_Subitle"> <b>Individual Wills and the General Will<br>
</b> </p>
<p> <span class="H_body_text">In reality, each individual may have one particular will as a
  man that is different from-or contrary to-the general will which
  he has as a citizen. His own particular interest may suggest other
  things to him than the common interest does. His separate, naturally
  independent existence may make him imagine that what he owes to
  the common cause is an incidental contribution - a contribution
  which will cost him more to give than their failure to receive
  it would harm the others. He may also regard the moral person
  of the State as an imaginary being since it is not a man, and
  wish to enjoy the rights of a citizen without performing the duties
  of a subject. This unjust attitude could cause the ruin of the
  body politic if it became widespread enough.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="H_body_text"> So that the social pact will not become meaningless words, it
  tacitly includes this commitment, which alone gives power to the
  others: Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be forced
  to obey it by the whole body politic, which means nothing else
  but that he will be forced to be free. This condition is indeed
  the one which by dedicating each citizen to the fatherland gives
  him a guarantee against being personally dependent on other individuals.
  It is the condition which all political machinery depends on and
  which alone makes political undertakings legitimate. Without it,
  political actions become absurd, tyrannical, and subject to the
  most outrageous abuses.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="H_body_text"> Whatever benefits he had in the state of nature but lost in the
  civil state, a man gains more than enough new ones to make up
  for them. His capabilities are put to good use and developed;
  his ideas are enriched, his sentiments made more noble, and his
  soul elevated to the extent that-if the abuses in this new condition
  did not often degrade him to a condition lower than the one he
  left behind-he would have to keep blessing this happy moment which
  snatched him away from his previous state and which made an intelligent
  being and a man out of a stupid and very limited animal....</span><br>
</p>
<p class="H_Subitle"> <b>Property Rights<br>
</b> </p>
<p> <span class="H_body_text">In dealing with its members, the State controls all their goods
  under the social contract, which serves as the basis for all rights
  within the State, but it controls them only through the right
  of first holder which individuals convey to the State....<br>
</span></p>
<p><span class="H_body_text"> A strange aspect of this act of alienating property rights to
  the state is that when the community takes on the goods of its
  members, it does not take these goods away from them. The community
  does nothing but assure its members of legitimate possession of
  goods, changing mere claims of possession into real rights and
  customary use into property.... Through an act of transfer having
  advantages for the public but far more for themselves they have,
  so to speak, really acquired everything they gave up....</span><br>
</p>
<p class="H_Subitle"> <b>Indivisible, Inalienable Sovereignty<br>
</b> </p>
<p> <span class="H_body_text">The first and most important conclusion from the principles we
  have established thus far is that the general will alone may direct
  the forces of the State to achieve the goal for which it was founded,
  the common good.... Sovereignty is indivisible ... and is inalienable....
  A will is general or it is not: it is that of the whole body of
  the people or only of one faction. In the first instance, putting
  the will into words and force is an act of sovereignty: the will
  becomes law. In the second instance, it is only a particular will
  or an administrative action; at the very most it is a decree. <br>
</span></p>
<p class="H_body_text"> Our political theorists, however, unable to divide the source
  of sovereignty, divide sovereignty into the ways it is applied.
  They divide it into force and will; into legislative power and
  executive power; into the power to tax, the judicial power, and
  the power to wage war; into internal administration and the power
  to negotiate with foreign countries. Now we see them running these
  powers together. Now they will proceed to separate them. They
  make the sovereign a being of fantasy, composed of separate pieces,
  which would be like putting a man together from several bodies,
  one having eyes, another arms, another feet-nothing more. Japanese
  magicians are said to cut up a child before the eyes of spectators,
  then throw the pieces into the air one after the other, and then
  cause the child to drop down reassembled and alive again. That
  is the sort of magic trick our political theorists perform. After
  having dismembered the social body with a trick worthy of a travelling
  show, they reassemble the pieces without anybody knowing how.... <br>
</p>
<p><span class="H_body_text"> If we follow up in the same way on the other divisions mentioned,
  we find that we are deceived every time we believe we see sovereignty
  divided. We find that the jurisdictions we have thought to be
  exercised as parts of sovereignty in reality are subordinate to
  the [one] sovereign power. They presuppose supreme wills, which
  they merely carry out in their jurisdictions . . . .</span><br>
</p>
<p class="H_Subitle"> <b>Need for Citizen Participation, Not Representation <br>
</b> </p>
<p> <span class="H_body_text">It follows from the above that the general will is always in the
  right and inclines toward the public good, but it does not follow
  that the deliberations of the people always have the same rectitude.
  People always desire what is good, but they do not always see
  what is good. You can never corrupt the people, but you can often
  fool them, and that is the only time that the people appear to
  will something bad....<br>
</span></p>
<p class="H_body_text"> If, assuming that the people were sufficiently informed as they
  made decisions and that the citizens did not communicate with
  each other, the general will would always be resolved from a great
  number of small differences, and the deliberation would always
  be good. But when blocs are formed, associations of parts at the
  expense of the whole, the will of each of these associations will
  be general as far as its members are concerned but particular
  as far as the State is concerned. Then we may say that there are
  no longer so many voters as there are men present but as many
  as there are associations. The differences will become less numerous
  and will yield less general results. Finally, when one of these
  associations becomes so strong that it dominates the others, you
  no longer have the sum of minor differences as a result but rather
  one single [unresolved] difference, with the result that there
  no longer is a general will, and the view that prevails is nothing
  but one particular view....<br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> But we must also consider the private persons who make up the
  public, apart from the public personified, who each have a life
  and liberty independent of it. It is very necessary for us to
  distinguish between the respective rights of the citizens and
  the sovereign and between the duties which men must fulfill in
  their role as subjects from the natural rights they should enjoy
  in their role as men.<br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> It is agreed that everything which each individual gives up of
  his power, his goods, and his liberty under the social contract
  is only that part of all those things which is of use to the community,
  but it is also necessary to agree that the sovereign alone is
  the judge of what that useful part is.<br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> All the obligations which a citizen owes to the State he must
  fulfill as soon as the sovereign asks for them, but the sovereign
  in turn cannot impose any obligation on subjects which is not
  of use to the community. If fact, the sovereign cannot even wish
  to do so, for nothing can take place without a cause according
  to the laws of reason, any more than according to the laws of
  nature [and the sovereign community will have no cause to require
  anything beyond what is of communal use]....<br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> Government . . is wrongly confused with the sovereign, whose agent
  it is. What then is government? It is an intermediary body established
  between the subjects and the sovereign to keep them in touch with
  each other. It is charged with executing the laws and maintaining
  both civil and political liberty.... The only will dominating
  government ... should be the general will or the law. The government's
  power is only the public power vested in it. As soon as [government]
  attempts to let any act come from itself completely independently,
  it starts to lose its intermediary role. If the time should ever
  come when the [government] has a particular will of its own stronger
  than that of the sovereign and makes use of the public power which
  is in its hands to carry out its own particular will-when there
  are thus two sovereigns, one in law and one in fact-at that moment
  the social union will disappear and the body politic will be dissolved. <br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> Once the public interest has ceased to be the principal concern
  of citizens, once they prefer to serve State with money rather
  than with their persons, the State will be approaching ruin. Is
  it necessary to march into combat? They will pay some troops and
  stay at home. Is it necessary to go to meetings? They will name
  some deputies and stay at home. Laziness and money finally leave
  them with soldiers to enslave their fatherland and representatives
  to sell it....<br>
</p>
<p><span class="H_body_text"> Sovereignty cannot be represented.... Essentially, it consists
  of the general will, and a will is not represented: either we
  have it itself, or it is something else; there is no other possibility.
  The deputies of the people thus are not and cannot be its representatives.
  They are only the people's agents and are not able to come to
  final decisions at all. Any law that the people have not ratified
  in person is void, it is not a law at all.</span><br>
</p>
<p class="H_Subitle"> <b>Sovereignty and Civil Religion<br>
</b> </p>
<p> <span class="H_body_text">Now then, it is of importance to the State that each citizen should
  have a religion requiring his devotion to duty; however, the dogmas
  of that religion are of no interest to the State except as they
  relate to morality and to the duties which each believer is required
  to perform for others. For the rest of it, each person may have
  whatever opinions he pleases....<br>
</span></p>
<p class="H_body_text"> It follows that it is up to the sovereign to establish the articles
  of a purely civil faith, not exactly as dogmas of religion but
  as sentiments of social commitment without which it would be impossible
  to be either a good citizen or a faithful subject.... While the
  State has no power to oblige anyone to believe these articles,
  it may banish anyone who does not believe them. This banishment
  is not for impiety but for lack of social commitment, that is,
  for being incapable of sincerely loving the laws and justice or
  of sacrificing his life to duty in time of need. As for the person
  who conducts himself as if he does not believe them after having
  publicly stated his belief in these same dogmas, he deserves the
  death penalty. He has lied in the presence of the laws.<br>
</p>
<p class="H_body_text"> The dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number,
  and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries.
  These are the required dogmas: the existence of a powerful, intelligent
  Divinity, who does good, has foreknowledge of all, and provides
  for all; the life to come; the happy rewards of the just; the
  punishment of the wicked; and the sanctity ol` the social contract
  and the laws. As for prohibited articles of faith, I limit myself
  to one: intolerance. Intolerance characterizes the religious persuasions
  we have excluded.<br>
