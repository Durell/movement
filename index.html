      <h3 align='center'><u>Hello Sifu!</u></h3>
      <p>I have procured this domain out of my love for martial arts out of which has come
         the desire to promote the study of arts that increases mind/body awareness and skill
         with your movements.  There are many other practices outside
         of martial arts that teach you skill in movement such as dance, painting, writing,
         even typing, sports, games, video games, Studying to expand your mind is a
         big part of increasing your skill in movement. Through the study of programming
         I have learned an immense amout about the psychology and decision making process
         of myself and others around me.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about martial arts and my sifu often says that he is 
         teaching us to be skilled in movement, thus the motivation for the naming of this site.
         I practice Kempo/Kajukenbo and Kung Fu at <a href="http://www.wcmaasd.com">West Cost Martial Arts Academy</a>
         with Sifu Giuseppe Aliotta.</p> 
      <p>Any practice where you have consistent repitition of actions to perfect muscle
         memory can make one skilled in many types of movements. Musicians will practice 
         moving across their instrument to consistently output the desired tones in the
         correct rhythm. Musicians train in very technical movements of the hands and fingers,
         whereas with other arts you might train at getting the whole body to move together. Some arts also
         translate to different applications as well, being able to deliver a strike with your
         whole body's movement behind it doesn't mean you can play guitar or vice versa. That isn't
         to say that knowing both won't help each other because there is a good probability it will. This will
      facilitate different perspectives from each art that can carry over to the other</p>
